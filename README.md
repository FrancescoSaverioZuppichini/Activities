# Activities
A vanilla bootstrap GUI for activity filtering based on 0-1 knapsack problem dynamic programming algorithm written by "Jon Deng".

I was inspired by this article so I decided to create a very simple GUI with bootstrap and Vue.js

It works by letting the user create an "activity" with "time" and "xp" then the algorithm decides the best combinations

To run it:

```
cd source
npm install
npm run dev
```
