# Activities
A vanilla bootstrap GUI for activity filtering based on 0-1 knapsack problem dynamic programming algorithm written by "Jon Deng".

I was inspired by this [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-dynamic-framework-for-finding-your-first-programming-job-b4eb0605b4f3#.1e7y65vz1) so I decided to create a very simple GUI with bootstrap and Vue.js

It works by let the user create an "activity" with "time" and "xp" then the algorith decides the best combinations

To run it:

```
cd source
npm install
npm run dev
```
